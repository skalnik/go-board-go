# Go board, Go!

An LED based Go board.

## Background

After the frustrations of a normal Go board being knocked around, @sshirokov &
myself started brainstorming how to make a board which is less susceptible to
pieces being knocked around. One of our DJ friends said we should mash it up
with a [Monome](http://monome.org/), and then once I stumbled upon the [4x4 LED
Compatible Button Pad](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/7835) on Sparkfun,
things have taken off from there.

## WIP

This project is still very much work in progress. Updates will happen randomly
as parts arrive and knowledge is gained. This is my first real electronics
project so it may take a while if you're following along. I was just stoked to
get the shift register working:
